			"description": "When Viam shifted from a robotics company to a smart machine company, you’d never felt more seen. AI’s all the rage, but it’s no threat to you. You can’t resist a good puzzle, and your brain seems to be an endless repository of random facts. When you’re not helping someone out with tasks beyond your own, you’re busy scrolling Slack looking for places to leave puns.",

You’re constantly asking “why,” coming up with new theories about the things around you, and resisting the urge to say “ontology” over lunch. You love nothing more than a good conversation, except maybe an accurate alignment chart.",

Even so, you’re the most productive member of your team – you somehow get everything done without any struggle. You don’t talk much, but you’re on top of all the office gossip.",

You love nothing more than a good debate – you even have a list of “hot takes” in your notes app. Your life is never boring. You’re always down to do it for the plot. And boy, that plot sure is thickening every day.",
